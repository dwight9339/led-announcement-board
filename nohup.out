Suggestion: to slightly improve display update, add
	isolcpus=3
at the end of /boot/cmdline.txt and reboot (see README.md)
FYI: not running as root which means we can't properly control timing unless this is a real-time kernel. Expect color degradation. Consider running as root with sudo.
Can't set realtime thread priority=99: Operation not permitted.
	You are probably not running as root ?
	This will seriously mess with color stability and flicker
	of the matrix. Please run as `root` (e.g. by invoking this
	program with `sudo`), or setting the capability on this
	binary by calling
	sudo setcap 'cap_sys_nice=eip' /usr/bin/python3.9
